jenniplus
=========
yano's jenni with more functionality

run `./applyPatches.sh`

Local changes in the `jenniplus` directory: Uncommitted changes will be kept, a dirty index will cause patch failure (will require `git am --abort`), committed changes will be moved to the "plus-old" branch and retained until you run the script again.
